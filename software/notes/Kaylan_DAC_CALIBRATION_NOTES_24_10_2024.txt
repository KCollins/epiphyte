CALLIBRATION DEVICE

- HOW DO WE FIND OPTIMAL AIR FLOW & HEATING
	- TARGET VARIABLE: CO2 SEQUESTRATION
	- FEATURES: TEMPERATURE THRESHOLDS, FAN SPEED / AIR FLOW
- TEST A RANGE AROUND THE LAB VALUES WILL GIVES US

- HOW DO WE DO THIS? WE NEED SENSORS IN LESS THAN OPTIMAL PLACES
	- INTAKE & OUTAKE (will interrupt air flow)
	- HUMIDITY

- ONCE WE'VE OPTIMIZED WE DON'T NEED THESE SENSORS ANYMORE

- DESORPTION STATE:
	- WHAT IS THE TEMPERATURE IN THE TUBE
	- WHAT IS THE STATE OF AIR FLOW (just use the sensor ig)
	- HOW MUCH CO2 IS BEING CAPTURED (Intake CO2 sensor - Outake sensor)

- ESTIMATING ERROR:
	- we can use the expected capture results from the lab
	- ERROR = (LAB_RESULT - ACTUAL RESULT)

WHY DOES HUMDITY MATTER -> HUMIDITY AFFECTS SORBENTS

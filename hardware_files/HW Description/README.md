# Epiphyte Electronic Hardware Description

## Overview
This document serves as a reference for the electronic hardware elements of the first prototype of Epiphyte. The design evolved as it was built, and I offer suggestions for improvement or modifications as appropriate.
In the interest of brevity, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with electronics and programming.

### Epiphyte System
The overall design of the Epiphyte system is shown in Figure 1, below, with a focus on the elements to be described in this document.
